I have always had a penchant for art. Since elementary school, I used to attempt hard sketches which were elusive and way beyond my league. With tiny fingers, I used to try holding huge paint brushes, palettes, spatulas without even knowing how to enunciate them properly. As time passed by, my paintings got better as I could finally get a firm grip over brushes and other art tools. I was never pretty keen on displaying my art work as I did it for myself. It gave me immense happiness to create magic with my hands. However, I felt that if my artwork made me happy, then why not bring a smile on other's faces too. I started putting up my art shows and participated in competitions. I won a lot of appreciation from others. 

Here are some of my paintings and sketches. I have given a title to each one with a tiny explanation of the emotions behind each one.
