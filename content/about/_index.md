I am Suhana Bedi. I was born and brought up in India. Currently, I am pursuing my undergraduate education from The University of Texas at Dallas. As a child, I was intrigued and fascinated about almost everything around me. I always felt that the world was full of mysteries and I aimed to explore and dive into each one of them before departing from this wondrous creation. I am proud to say that I stick with the same ideals today as well. 
Back in India, my major hobby was painting. I specialized in archaic forms of Indian art. On the academic front, I did fairly well in all subjects but my personal favorites were Math and Biology. However, I never knew that I could amalgamate these two favorites of mine. 
After coming to US, I chose Data Science as my major and Biological Sciences as my minor. I joined a research lab, specialized in Computational Biology, and within few days, I was certain that I had found my dream career path. I loved (still love :sweat_smile:) using databases and other mathematical models to predict biological mechanisms. I felt I had entered a whole new world which was hidden from for all these years. Today, as I am writing this "About Me" section, I feel elated as well as anxious to explore more facets of this field which are still hidden from me. 

So, I guess that is a super tiny description of myself :grin:. You can have a look at my resum√© for a more elaborate account of my work so far. 

Feel free to reach out to me in case you have any questions or queries about me or my work. :smiley:
